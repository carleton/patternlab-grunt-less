It is likely that many students enrolling in the&nbsp;minor will major in either biology or chemistry. To encourage breadth within the minor, <em>no more than five</em> six-credit courses from a studentâ€™s own major may be counted toward the minimum requirements of the minor.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="//apps.carleton.edu/curricular/biol/">biology</a> and <a href="//apps.carleton.edu/curricular/chem/">chemistry</a> departments maintain vigorous weekly seminar programs, regularly bringing to the college distinguished scientists, including many biochemists. Each minor should make it a priority to attend relevant seminars whenever possible.</p>

<p>Finally, both the chemistry and biology departments regularly offer integrative exercise experiences in biochemistry as an option for their majors. Minors who are biology or chemistry majors have the option of furthering their pursuit of biochemistry through a biochemical topic as the basis for their senior integrative exercise.&nbsp;</p></div>
